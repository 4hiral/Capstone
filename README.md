# Data Gap Prediction in IoT: An ML-Based Approach for Smart Systems

This project presents a machine learning-based solution to handle **data gaps in IoT systems**, particularly in **smart environments** like smart cities, agriculture, or industrial monitoring. Using historical sensor data and real-time inputs, our model predicts missing temperature values during transmission failures to maintain data continuity and support intelligent decision-making.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

In real-world IoT deployments, sensor data may occasionally be **lost** due to network issues, power loss, or hardware glitches. This project aims to:

- Collect temperature and humidity data using **Arduino Uno** in real-time.
- Train a regression model to **predict missing temperature values** based on historical patterns.
- Handle **missing data** intelligently without compromising the accuracy of downstream analytics.
- Incorporate **seasonal trends** using time and month-based features for improved predictions.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Arduino Uno** (for real-time data collection)
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **CSV for data storage and model training**
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation
